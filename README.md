# Machine_Learning_Projects
This repository contains datasets that cover 9,578 loans funded by www.lendingclub.com between May 2007 and February 2010. In this industry, two questions are critical:

1.) How risky is the borrower?

2.) Given the borrower's risk, shall we lend him/her?

## Predicting Loan repayment - data preprocessing with Jupyter Notebook
A key step in any machine learning (ML) is the pre-processing one. During which you understand the story you will tell, remove or interpolate NAN data point, basic statistical analysis, and sort the data.

The aim of this project is to predict if the borrower can repay the loan by its mature date or not. In this project, I will focus on the preprocessing step:

STEP 1/

1.) Examining and understanding the datasets

2.) What are the data tyoes for each features?

3.) Do we have any missing values? If so, how to address them.

4.) Do we have imbalanced datasets?


STEP 2/

1.) How to prepare the features for Machine Learning?

  1.1) Identify the categorical features in the datasets.
  
  1.2) How to convert categorical columns to numeric features? 
  
  
Once the datasets are cleaned and prepared, there are ready for a Machine Learning project!
