# Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1 (done)
This folder contains 8 projects that I have done throughout the Standford Machine Learning (ML) online course. The project emcompasses the development and the implementation of ML algorithms such as

  #### 1./ Supervised Learning: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and SVMs. 
  #### 2./ Unsupervised Learning: K-means, PCA, Anomaly Detection, and Recommender System

## Project 2 - Data Preprocessing, Processing: Loan Eligibility Prediction (Done)
The aim of this project is to create a loan model that predict if a borrower is more likely to paid off his/her debts. In this project, I show step by step processes how to process raw data, clean unnecessary part of it, select relevant features, perform exploratory data analysis, and finally build a model.

The project is accessible in this [link](https://github.com/adjanni/Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/DataPreprocessing_Predicting_Loan_Repayment)

## Project 3 - Credit card fraud detection (on going ...)
The aim of this project is to build an optimal ML models that could predict if a transaction is fraudulent or not! In this project, I implement various supervised Supervised Learning algorithms. The performance of each technique is evalued based on the confusion matrix and f1-score - I have implemented the following algorithms 
  #### 1./ KNN: this is an instance based learning which carries out its classification based on similarity measured like Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, Hamming distance or even Cosine Similarity. I have ysed the Euclidian distance in this step.
  #### 2./ SVMs
  #### 3./ Neural Network
  #### 4./ K-Means
